 * harness loads the built file over file:// with no network at all — a CDN
 * script there would silently fail and every motion assertion would go with
 * it. So the build copies the exact installed version next to the page and
 * points the tags at it. Version drift is impossible: these are the same
 * files npm resolved, not a URL that might serve something else later.
